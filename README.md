Repository to show case my programming capability.

My level of problem solving : can write a solution to find the determinant value of a square matrix.  I did not see this problem statement in coding interview preparation sites. 

All solutions are written by myself.  Problem statements are given as comments in the beginning of the file

Sometimes i read in internet about the problem statements but not the solutions.
